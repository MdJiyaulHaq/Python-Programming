# Browser Automation

This repository contains various scripts and tools for automating browser tasks using Python. The primary library used is Selenium, which allows for controlling web browsers programmatically.

There are also examples of using Playwright for browser automation, which is another powerful library that supports multiple browsers and provides a more modern API.

# Steps to run the scripts:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium playwright
   ```

2. **Download WebDriver**: For Selenium, you need to download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

3. **Run the Scripts**: You can run the scripts directly from the command line or through an IDE. For example:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
